# Conditional aggregation-based Choquet integral computation

This repository contains the software implementation of generalized survival function calculation and the calculation of conditional aggregation-based Choquet integral on discrete space, which is a part of the paper entitled "Conditional aggregation-based Choquet integral on discrete space".

The software implementation provides the calculation of 
* generalized survival function 
* and conditional aggregation-based Choquet integral
</li> on discrete space using the relationships studied in cited paper. 
The source folder contains java codes, the main file is Launcher.java, the main calculations takes place in the CAOChoquetIntegral.java class.<br />
